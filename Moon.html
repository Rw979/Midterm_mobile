          <p>After Houyi saved the people from harm. Many people worshipped him as their teacher and learned from him. 
         Houyi's wife <strong>Chang 'e </strong>was a beautiful and kind-hearted woman. One day, <strong>Queen Mother of the West </strong> on the Kunlun Mountain gave Houyi a  pill of immortality. People who eat the pill can become immortal as a god in heaven. However, Houyi was not willing to leave Chang 'e, so he let her hide the pill in a treasure chest.

          <p>This was somehow known to Pang Meng,  a treacherous and greedy student of Houyi. Early in the morning on August 15, Houyi and the students were out for teaching, Pang Meng pretended to be sick and stayed. At night, Pang Meng, wielding a sword, eagerly broke into Houyi's house and threatened Chang 'e to give him the pill. After Chang’e ‘s refusal, Pang Meng rummaged around and searched in the house. Seeing that the treasure box was about to be searched, Chang 'e rushed forward, took out the fairy medicine, and swallowed it.

         <p>
        Chang’e flew out of the window, over the silver-lit countryside, higher and higher. Blue night sky is hanging with a bright moon, Chang 'e has been flying towards the moon.

        Houyi came back and ran towards the moon in desperation. But when he took three steps forward, the moon took three steps back, and he never could catch up.

        The villagers miss the good Chang 'e very much, and put the food Chang 'e loves to eat in the yard on weekdays, and bless her. Since then, every August 15, it has become the Mid-Autumn Festival that people look forward to reunion.
