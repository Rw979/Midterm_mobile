        <p>In the northern wilderness, there lived a group of mighty giants. Their leader was Kuafu.


         One year, the sun scorched the crops, the trees, and dried up the rivers.

         Kuafu saw this scene very sad, he said: "The sun is really hateful, I want to catch the sun, and let it listen to the command." After hearing this, the clansmen dissuaded them

         <p>However, Kuafu made up his mind and vowed to catch the sun.
         Kuafu ran after the sun, seeing closer to the sun after nine days and nine nights, where the sun set, Kuafu finally caught up with it. 
         <br><br>
         But the sun was extremely hot, Kuafu felt thirsty and tired. He ran to the Yellow River and drank it dry. He ran to the Weihe River and drank up the water, but he still could not quench his thirst. Kuafu ran to the north again, there were thousands of miles of Daze (the sea), Daze water enough Kuafu quenched their thirst. However, Kuafu died of thirst on the way to Daze.
